# Janky-VIM
This is just a repo to track all my janky vim hacks. Feel free to steal whatever you want.

# Setup
Needs `vim >= 8`, so that you can stick this in your `.bashrc` allowing the .vimrc file to be global:
```
export VIMINIT='source $MYVIMRC'
export MYVIMRC='~/.vim/.vimrc'  #or any other location you want
```
